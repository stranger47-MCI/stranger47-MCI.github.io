I'm a second-year Ph.D. student from [Institute of Medical Technology](https://imt.bjmu.edu.cn/) and [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://bme.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). 

My research interest:

·medical image

·biomechanics

·deep learning

·3D organ reconstruction

·finite element analysis.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luo](https://bme.bjmu.edu.cn/szdw/223027.htm) of BBD-Lab from [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://bme.bjmu.edu.cn/), Peking University.
